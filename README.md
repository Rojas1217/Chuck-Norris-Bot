# Chuck-Norris-Bot
This is a simple Reddit bot that responds to comments with a randomly fetched Chuck Norris joke.

To explain briefly, it scans all the comments in a particular subreddit and saves the comment IDs in a text file. It then fetches a random Chuck Norris joke from [The Internet Chuck Norris Database](http://www.icndb.com/) which has a friendly page on the site where they already grab a [random joke and put it into a json format](http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random) for you.
